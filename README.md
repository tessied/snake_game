# snake_game
A game where the player moves a snake that grows in length

## Gameplay
- Run `main.py` to start the game
- Do NOT resize the screen
- Use the `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, and `Right` arrows to move the snake across the screen
- If the snake hits the wall, the game ends
- If the snake runs into itself, the game ends
- The high score that I have achieved will be displayed on the screen; if you beat the highest score, the new high score will be displayed
- Currently, the only way to end the game is to exit out of the screen
